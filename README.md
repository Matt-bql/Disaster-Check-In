# Disaster Check-In
This is an app currently in progress that will provide victims of natural disasters to login and checkin with friends and family.
It is inspired by living in an area experiencing yearly hurricanes that disrupt the area.
Nothing is copy/pasted.

As seen in the GIF above, users can login and view posts only visible to users. 
The posts are expandable, disabling scrolling of the window when open, and enables users to click outside to exit the modal. (will be adding exit button soon)

Accessibility with different devices is key, which is why I have a close focus on how my app reacts on devices of all sizes.

# This app uses various technologies below.

REACT

AWS
* Amplify- for user authentication(user pools/cognito)
