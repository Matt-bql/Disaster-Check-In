Disaster Check-in
This is an app for checking in on friends and family during natural disasters. I thought of this app after realizing how many of my own family stress to stay in contact with each other every hurricane season.

This is an ongoing project and is in the early stages.

This app uses: 

REACT
React Router
UUID

AWS specific tech, deployed using the CLI to keep all services in sync.
Amplify
Cognito
S3
Lambda
CloudFormation

Styling was done using Tailwind.
